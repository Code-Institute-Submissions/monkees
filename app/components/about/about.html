    The sitcom they starred in between September 1966 to March 1968 was popular but stunted their creativity due
    to the priority of recording their scenes. They eventualy found some middle ground and earned the right to take
    more creative control musicaly.

    At their height in 1967 they outsold the Beatles and the Rolling Stones combined. They have sold over 75 million
    records worldwide.
